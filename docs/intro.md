# Introduction

Hi Mom and Armando, I will be out of the house tomorrow morning. Sorry
about that, but to help you both get through the morning, I've included
breakfast recipes for you both to use. The first two recipes are for
Mom, and the last two are for Armando. (Don't worry Armando, your
recipes are vegan.) I hope the recipes are easy to follow and whatever
you make turns out great.
