# How To Make Dosa and Idli Podi (Vegan)

## Introduction

If you are unfamiliar, dosa is a typical vegan and Indian breakfast food
comparable to crepes. This recipe pairs it with idli podi, which is a
spicy dip paired with dosa. This recipe makes 3 dosa and enough podi to
pair with those 3 dosa. You can add as much or as little of the
ingredients to match how much dosa you'd like.

## Ingredients

-   Readymade dosa batter

-   ¼ cup Readymade idli podi

-   A Skillet

-   Spatula

-   Ladle

-   Olive Oil

-   1 teaspoon sesame oil

## Instructions

1.  Place your skillet onto your stove.

2.  Set the stove temperature to high.

3.  Drizzle a very small amount of sesame oil onto the skillet.

4.  Scoop a full ladle's worth of dosa batter out of the batter
    container.

5.  Pour the batter from the ladle into the center of the hot skillet.

6.  Immediately use the ladle to start spreading the poured batter in a
    circle clockwise and outwards, as pictured below. Do this until you
    reach the edge of the batter.

*Figure 3. This image illustrates how your dosa batter should look when
spread out.*

TROUBLESHOOTING: If your batter can't be spread due to it sticking,
this means you need to try again and reduce the temperature.

7.  Once the bottom of the dosa is crisp and brown, take the dosa off
    the skillet with a spatula and set it on a plate.

8.  Repeat steps 4 through 7 two more times to have 3 dosa prepared in
    total.

9.  Turn off the stove and take your skillet off the stove.

10.  In a small bowl, pour your idli podi and sesame oil in that order.

11.  Mix the idli podi and oil with your finger until fully mixed. It
    should look as such in the below figure.

12.  Enjoy your dosa and idli podi by ripping off pieces of the dosa and
    dipping them in the idli podi.
